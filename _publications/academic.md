excerpt: 'I developed this notes with the colaboration of Marcelo Gallardo (PUCP). It contains a basic and introductory proof of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem under its specific application in general equilibrium theory (GE). Furthemore, we focus on showing the existence of a unique equilibrium under certain conditions and assumptions. The purpose was to present to the interested student the mathematical architecture that supports GE'
